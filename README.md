# 🧠 AI Mental Health Support Agent  
### Capstone Project – Google × Kaggle AI Intensive Workshop 2025

An AI-powered **Mental Health Support Agent** designed to provide empathetic conversations, detect emotional distress, perform safety checks, and escalate high-risk situations through a Long-Running Operation (LRO) mechanism.

Track: Agents for Good (Healthcare & Well-being)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **agentic AI systems** can support mental well-being by combining empathy, safety awareness, and structured decision-making.

The agent is capable of:
- Understanding user emotions
- Providing supportive, non-medical responses
- Detecting safety-critical language
- Escalating high-risk cases for human review
- Operating under responsible AI and privacy-first principles

Built as part of the **Google × Kaggle AI Intensive Workshop 2025** under the **“Agents for Good”** track.

## 🧩 Why Agents?

Traditional LLMs often struggle with:
- Maintaining emotional context across interactions
- Handling safety-critical conversations
- Deciding when escalation is required
- Managing structured workflows

Agent-based systems address these challenges by:
- Using tools for reasoning and decision-making
- Maintaining conversational state
- Executing safety logic conditionally
- Supporting long-running operations (LROs)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Conversation (Support) Agent  
Handles empathetic and emotionally aware dialogue.

### 2️⃣ Emotion Detection Tool  
Analyzes user input for emotional signals such as:
- sadness
- stress
- anxiety
- risk indicators

### 3️⃣ Safety Check Tool  
Evaluates whether the conversation requires escalation.

### 4️⃣ LRO Escalation Agent  
Triggers human review during high-risk situations using a simulated Long-Running Operation.

### 5️⃣ Final Output Agent  
Returns a structured response summarizing decisions and suggested support actions.
